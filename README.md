# Carry-Lookahead-Adder

A 4 bit carry lookahead adder circuit with a custom half adder and a CLA logic block.

## Summary
After seeing a lack of examples of CLA adders on the internet, I figure I show my\n own.

## How to open
1. Download LogiSim from SourceForge: https://sourceforge.net/projects/circuit/
2. Save this .circ file to a folder on your computer.
3. Under **File** in LogiSim, click **Open** and find the path to the .circ file and open it.

## Roadmap
- Implement a 7 segment decimal display to easily display the I/O.
